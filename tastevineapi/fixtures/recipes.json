Add 1/3 c warm milk and instant yeast to a large mixing bowl or to a stand mixer bowl. Let the yeast activate while you make the paste.\n3. In the same pot the milk cooked in, add 1/3 c milk, 1/2 c hot tap water and 1/3 c bread flour. Turn heat to medium and whisk until a thick paste forms and the lumps are all worked out. Set aside.\n4. To the yeast and milk add the sugar, melted salted butter, egg, salt and prepared paste. Mix on low until everything is combined.\n5. Add 2/3 c bread flour a cup at a time to the mixture. Allow it to come together then switch out the paddle for the dough hook. Knead for 15 minutes.\n6. Place dough ball in a lightly greased bowl and cover for an hour in a warm dry place. I either preheat my oven to 100 degrees and turn it off once I put the bowl in the oven or I place in the microwave (off of course).\n7. Roll dough out on a floured surface to 24x15\" -- I use a measuring tape to make sure I get the size right.\n8. Spread 8 tbsp or a stick of softened kerrygold salted butter evenly over top of the dough. It needs to be extra soft but not melted.\n9. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl then sprinkle on top of the butter and dough evenly.\n10. Tightly roll up the dough and cut into 10-12 rolls.\n11. Place on a parchment lined sheet pan with space between each roll.\n12. Warm heavy whipping cream and pour over the rolls.\n13. Bake at 375 for 18-20 minutes.\n14. While the rolls bake, mix the icing with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer. Add cream cheese, salted butter and beat until fluffy. Add powdered sugar one cup at a time. Scrape the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla and mix until fully combined.\n15. Allow rolls to rest 5-10 minutes before slathering in icing.",

With the mixer on low add 3 2/3 C bread flour to the bowl one cup at a time.\nOnce the dough comes together, switch to a dough hook and knead for 15 minutes or knead by hand (with both hands) for 15 minutes. If kneading by hand, work that dough good. You should be tired after this process.\nTransfer dough to a greased bowl, cover and let rise for one hour.\nPunch the dough. And start forming your rolls. You want the dough balls to be bigger than golf balls but not quite as big as a tennis ball. I get 15 out of the recipe.\nPlace in a greased baking dish or greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise for another hour.\nOnce rolls have risen brush with egg wash and bake at 350 for 20 minutes uncovered.\nFor the cinnamon butter mix softened butter, powder sugar, honey and cinnamon together with a fork or use a hand mixer.",
